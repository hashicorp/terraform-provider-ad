This Windows AD provider for Terraform allows you to manage users, groups and group policies in your AD installation.

This provider is a technical preview, which means it's a community supported project. It still requires extensive testing and polishing to mature into a HashiCorp officially supported project. Please [file issues](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-ad/issues/new/choose) generously and detail your experience while using the provider. We welcome your feedback.

## Requirements

* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) version 0.12.x+
* [Windows Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server) 2012R2 or greater 
* [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) version 1.14.x+

## Getting Started

If this is your first time here, you can get an overview of the provider by reading our [introductory blog post](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/manage-active-directory-objects-new-windows-ad-provider-hashicorp-terraform). Otherwise, start by downloading a copy of our latest build from the [registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/ad/latest).

Once you have the plugin installed, review the [docs](docs/) folder to understand which configuration options are available. You can find examples and more in [our examples folder](examples/). Don't forget to run `terraform init` in your Terraform configuration directory to allow Terraform to detect the provider plugin.
