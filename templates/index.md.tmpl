# AD (Active Directory) Provider

The AD (Active Directory) provider provides resources to interact with an AD domain controller.

Requirements:
 - Windows Server 2012R2 or greater.
 - WinRM enabled.

## Note about Kerberos Authentication

Starting with version 0.4.0, this provider supports Kerberos Authentication for WinRM connections.
The underlying library used for Kerberos authentication supports setting its configuration by parsing
a configuration file as specified in this [page](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/admin/conf_files/krb5_conf.html).
If a configuration file is not supplied then we will use the equivalent of the following config:

```
[libdefaults]
   default_realm = YOURDOMAIN.COM
   dns_lookup_realm = false
   dns_lookup_kdc = false

[realms]
	YOURDOMAIN.COM = {
        kdc 	= 	192.168.1.122
        admin_server = 192.168.1.122
        default_domain = YOURDOMAIN.COM
	}

[domain_realm]
	yourdomain.com = YOURDOMAIN.COM
```

where `YOURDOMAIN.COM` is the value of the `krb_realm` setting, and 192.168.1.122 is the value of `winrm_hostname`.
